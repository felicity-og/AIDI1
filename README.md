# Task: Build an ML model using the fish market dataset 
The fish market dataset, contains measurements of fish of seven different species.

**Input(features):**
• 3 different lengths
• height
• width
• weight

**Output (species):**
• bream
• roach
• whitefish
• parkki
• perch
• pike
• smelt

Given the dataset, we can choose a regression or classification problem. 
I would use a classfication algorithm using Logistic regression to predict the species of fish based on 
the measurements of weight, height, width and length. 

To evalute the model, I would employ the accuracy score and the confusion matrix only and display a new 
table comapring the test values and the prediction values.

The model produced an accuracy of 84% which could be further inmproved on in the future.
