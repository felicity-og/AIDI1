**Description of tasks**

AIM: Create a Machine Learning modle to predict the type/ stage of Breast Cancer. 

Two stages as shown in the dataset : Benign and Malignant. 

Due to the nature of the problem i.e. classification, a supervised learning - classification technique is required.

Version 1 of the model used the Random forest classifier which has an accuracy of 96%.

Version 2 of the model used the Logistic Regression classifier which has an accuracy of 94%.
